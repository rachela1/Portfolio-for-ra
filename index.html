    <p>My name is Rachel Ardry. I have been in coding bootcamp for almost three weeks.
      I am 25 years old. I was born and raised in Columbia Tennessee which is still my current place of residence. I
      graduated from Columbia State Community College in 2018, and
      ever since then I had been wanting to have a career that involved computers in some capacity. This is my first
      experience with coding.</p>
